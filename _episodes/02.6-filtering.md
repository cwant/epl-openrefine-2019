## Filtering

With so many records in the dataset, it's sometimes useful to only look at a subset of the data.
Faceting was introduced to do this, but this technique does not work well with data that has
a lot of different, free-form data. The `Title` column is an example of such data: you
can add a text facet, but there are 3248 different values to facet through. Luckily
OpenRefine has a more general-purpose text filter for these kinds of fields.

Let's look at a subset of the data, filtered by title:

1. Click the down arrow next to `Title` > `Text filter`. A `Title` filter panel will appear on the left margin.
2. Type in `tidying` and press return. There are 1270 matching rows of the original 33321 rows.
3. At the top, change the view to `Show` 50 `rows`. This way you will see most of the matching rows.

Note that the `Title` column is pretty squished in the view in OpenRefine. We can make more room
for it by collapsing other columns, in particular the `Web URL` column that we won't use. Click
on the `Web URL` menu in the column header and select `View` > `Collapse this column`.

> ## Exercise
>
> 1. How many distinct titles match this 'tidying' pattern? (Hint: add a facet after adding your filter)
> 2. Do you see any potential problems with this data?
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. Do `Facet` > `Text facet` on the `Title` column after filtering. This will show that
> > six titles match your filter criteria.
> > 2. Some of these titles represent the same item, except that the author information has some
> >    variation.

> ## To Fix!
> We have now identified some more data to clean:
>
> * There are inconsistencies in the way titles are entered. A lot of the
>   problems are due to the combination of title and author both being
>   encoded into the title.
>
> We'll work on this later when we look at splitting data in fields.
