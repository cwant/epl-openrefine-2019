## Using undo and redo.

It's common while exploring and cleaning a dataset to discover after you've made a change that you
really should have done something else first.
OpenRefine provides `Undo` and `Redo` operations to make this easy.

OpenRefine goes beyond this though.

Every time you modify data, a new entry is added to an undo stack.
The undo stack provides a full history of the changes
to your data and lets you jump between different revisions.

> ## Exercise
>
> 1. Click where it says `Undo / Redo` on the left side of the screen.
>    For a new project, you should only see one entry in the panel called `0. Create project`.
> 2. Hover over any the cell on row one in the `Title` column. The word `edit` will appear. Click on it.
> 3. Edit this entry however you see fit.
> 4. Now you will see a new entry in a stack: `1. Edit single cell on row 1, column Title`.
> 5. Repeat this process as often as you would like, and observe as new entries are added to the stack.
> 6. Click on any of the steps in the `Undo/Redo` panel. Notice how your data reverts to the way
>    it was at the time of that step.
> 7. Notice that you can still click on the later steps to `Redo` the actions.
>    Before moving on to the next lesson, undo all of the edits that you have made to the data so far.
