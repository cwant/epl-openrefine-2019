## What the data says and what it doesn't say

Among other data, each row includes the following information:

1. A branch name
2. A title
3. An author
4. A date the information was sampled
5. The number of holds by people who's home branch matches the branch name

Question: If I have a date and a title, can I add up the rows in the spreadsheet that match to get an indication of the total number of holds?
Answer: Not really. This data is for those branches for which the title was in the top 10 holds. This will not include data for branches where the title was not in the top 10 titles, so we will not get the total number of holds.

Question: If I have a branch name and a title, can I add up the number of holds to get the total number of people requesting that item at that branch?
Answer: No. Suppose you wait longer than a week for your hold to come, then you will be included in two different weeks worth of data.

Question: Can I use the data to determine how many weeks a title was in the top 10 at a branch?
Answer: Yes. You would filter the title and the branch and count the number of rows.
