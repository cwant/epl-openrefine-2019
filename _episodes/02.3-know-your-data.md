## What the data says and what it doesn't say

### The data
Each row includes the following information:

1. Branch ID
2. Branch Name
3. Number of Holds
4. Title
5. Author
6. As of Date
7. Web URL

Given a row like this one:

|Branch ID|Branch Name|Number of Holds|Title|Author|As of Date|Web URL|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|EPLLON|Londonderry Branch|36|The girl on the train / Paula Hawkins|Hawkins Paula|03/16/2015 12:00:00 AM|http://epl.bibliocommons.com/search?t=smart&q=the%20girl%20on|

We can interpret this in words as **"On the week preceding March 16, 2015, `The girl on the train` by
`Paula Hawkins` was one of the top-ten most requested items at the `Londonderry Branch`.
There were `36` holds for this item".**

Note that for this week and for this branch, there will be nine other rows containing the
other top-ten titles.

### Questions about the data

Think about the data as a collection, and contemplate the following questions:

> ## Question
> Notice that the above row does not give us enough information to tell us
> what position in the
> top-ten `The girl on the train` was at `Londonderry Branch` on `March 16, 2015`.
> 
> But can we figure this out from this data set?
> > ## Answer
> > Yes. In general to answer questions like this, we need to find all of the items in
> > the top ten for that week at the
> > Londonderry Branch (there should be 10 of them).
> > We can then order by the number of holds to find out
> > where `The girl on the train` sat that week.
> > In our case, our data already has some organization to it, and we can answer this
> > question by looking at the first ten rows of our data file.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Question
> Is there any information in our data set that is either redundant or highly
> correlated?
> > ## Answer
> > Ideally, the `Branch ID` and the `Branch Name` fields should be pretty closely correlated.
> > 
> > The `Title` data also includes author information.
> >
> > Probably the `Web URL` will hold similar information as `Title`.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Question
> If I have a date and a title, can I add up the holds in the rows in the data
> that match to get
> an indication of the total number of holds for that item at that date for all of EPL?
> > ## Answer
> > Not really. This data is for those branches for which the title was in the top 10 holds.
> > This will not include data for branches where the title was not in the top 10 titles,
> > so we will not get the total number of holds.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Question
> If I have a branch name and a title, can I add up the number of holds over the weeks to
> get the total number of people requesting that item at that branch?
> > ## Answer
> > No. Suppose you wait longer than a week for your hold to come, then you will be included
> > in at least two different weeks worth of data, and you will be counted twice
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Question
> Can I use the data to determine how many weeks a title was in the top 10 at a particular branch?
> > ## Answer
> > Yes. You would look for the rows where the title and the branch match
> > and count the number of rows.
